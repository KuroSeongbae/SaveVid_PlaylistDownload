# SaveVid_PlaylistDownload

This Project aims to download YouTube Playlists automatically with SaveVid.
You need to have Firefox Browser installed and of course SaveVid.
All other utilities are downloaded with this project.

## How it works
When you start this program it will ask you for an URL. The URL is the first entry you want to download from your Playlist.
